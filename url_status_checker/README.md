## URL STATUS CHECKER

This script goes through each line in a file and prints out the http status code including redirects.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements preferably in a virtual environment.

Run the script with `python checker.py NAME_OF_FILE` where `NAME_OF_FILE` is the name of the file containing the urls.
